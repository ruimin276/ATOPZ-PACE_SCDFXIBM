# ATOPZ-PACE_SCDFXIBM
- Collecting information about the potential in danger people and distribute specially designed wrist bands to them
- Wrist band integrates devices to detect: temperature, breath rate, heart rate, blood pressure etc.
- The data will be kept inside the wrist band
- The wrist band will also integrate a module that periodically analyses and sends data to the main database (in hospital for example)
- When an anomaly was detected (sudden drop in heart rate for example), an emergency alert will be triggered to inform relevant authorities (hospital/clinic) that the person is in danger
